    Each tag does something different. For example:
        - The <html> tag defines the whole document.
        - The <h1> tag defines a large heading
        - The <p> tag defines a paragraph
        - Tags appear as an opening <div> and closing </div> pair

             The two separate graphs, created from the Economics Observatory API, display U.S. GDP growth and nuclear power output trends from 2000 to 2023. One graph highlights the trajectory of economic growth, while the other focuses on the evolution of nuclear energy production, providing independent insights into both areas over time.
